## Key Project Instructions

The application was structured according to the following key guidelines:

### Planning

**Project Structure:** <br>Outline the application's components, functions, and overall structure before development.

### App Structure

**Minimum Pages Required:** <br> At least two pages: 1. Homepage and 2. Shop page containing the Shopping Cart.
<br>

**Navigation Bar:** <br> A fixed navigation menu present on all pages for easy user navigation.
<br>

**Shopping Cart Indicator:** <br> Accessible from every page, displaying the current number of items in the cart and providing a direct link to the cart page.

### Design

**Homepage:** <br> Creatively design with the freedom to include images, text, or other elements.
<br>

**Cart Page:** <br> Display the number of items in the cart. Include a "Checkout" button, though the actual checkout functionality is not implemented in this assignment.
<br><br>

**Product Cards:** <br>Each product is displayed within a card that includes: <br>

- Product title
- An input box for manual quantity entry
- Increment and decrement buttons to adjust item quantity
- An "Add To Cart" button
